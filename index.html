   <p>Frontend and backend are two essential components of web development. The **frontend** refers to the part of a website or application that users interact with directly, including the design, layout, and user interface (UI). It is built using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a seamless and visually appealing experience. The **backend**, on the other hand, is the server-side part that handles the data processing, storage, and logic that power the frontend. It involves working with databases, servers, and APIs, and is built using programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js. Together, frontend and backend ensure the functionality and interactivity of modern web applications.</p>

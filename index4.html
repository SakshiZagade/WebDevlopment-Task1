    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Frontend development focuses on creating the user interface and client-side interactions of a web application using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. It involves designing responsive layouts, ensuring user accessibility, and optimizing performance for various devices. Backend development, on the other hand, deals with server-side logic, data management, and business processes. It uses languages like Node.js, Python, and Java, and handles database interactions with SQL or NoSQL systems. The backend also ensures security, user authentication, and scalability while managing server deployment and performance. Together, frontend and backend work cohesively to deliver a seamless and dynamic web experience.</p>
